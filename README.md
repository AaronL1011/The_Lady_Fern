# The Lady Fern - Florist Marketplace

This e-commerce web application is being developed for a local florist in order to boost their sales during the COVID-19 isolation period and beyond. With the strict social distancing rules set in place, this business owner is finding it difficult to continue regular operations as local markets and gatherings are no longer allowed to take place.

Global economy has been affected by this pandemic, and small business are finding it challenging to stay afloat. With the implementation of an online platform for selling goods, this allows businesses to continue to sustain themselves, whilst also driving the economy and potentially pulling the country futher towards an economic upturn.
